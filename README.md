# BlockBreakerTemplate
In this repository we find a template for developing a Block Braker game in Unity To do so, just duplicate a level and add/remove blocks. I have based my work on [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/).

We have the necessary files to load the project and an executable inside the Builds folder. Also, in [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ygzprZ-YeY&list=PLB9_8zTTrVjrCGwse6iae4oY9OeJVtho_&index=6) you can find a demo video.
